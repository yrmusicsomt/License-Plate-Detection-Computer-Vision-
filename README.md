# **Automatic Number Plate Detection Project**  

## **Project Overview**  
This project implements an **Automatic Number Plate Detection System** using image processing techniques in MATLAB. The system identifies and extracts the region containing a vehicle's license plate from input images, making it suitable for applications such as traffic monitoring, toll collection, and automated parking systems.  

---

## **Features**  
- **Color-Independent Processing**: Converts RGB images to grayscale for efficient processing.  
- **Histogram Analysis**: Horizontal and vertical histograms are calculated to identify probable regions containing the license plate.  
- **Region of Interest (ROI) Extraction**: Filters irrelevant areas and extracts the region with the **highest histogram values**.  
- **Robust Performance**: Works with varying image resolutions, lighting conditions, and minor tilts (8-10 degrees).

## **Steps in the Algorithm**  
1. **Input Image**: Read the input image (RGB) and convert it to **grayscale**.  
2. **Dilation**: Enhance edges and fill holes to improve edge detection.  
3. **Histogram Analysis**:  
   - Calculate horizontal and vertical histograms of pixel differences.  
   - Smooth histograms using a **low-pass filter**.  
4. **Dynamic Thresholding**: Remove areas with low histogram values to retain probable license plate regions.  
5. **ROI Extraction**: Identify the region with the **maximum histogram value** as the license plate.  
6. **Output**: Display the detected license plate region.

## **System Requirements**  
- **Software**: MATLAB (R2018a or later recommended)  
- **Input**: Images in common formats (e.g., JPG, PNG)  
- **Resolution**: 680×480 to 1600×1200

## **How to Run**  
1. Place the input image in the project directory.  
2. Open the MATLAB script and update the image filename (`CAR2.jpg`).  
3. Run the script in MATLAB.  
4. The program will display:  
   - Original Image  
   - Processed Image (Grayscale, Dilated)  
   - Histograms (Horizontal and Vertical)  
   - Extracted License Plate Region

## **Applications**  
- Traffic Monitoring Systems  
- Automated Toll Collection  
- Parking Management Systems  
- Vehicle Tracking
